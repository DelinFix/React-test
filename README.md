#React test project
 In this project, I show my knowledge of React without\
 using third-party libraries like **Redux** or **TypeScript**.\
 I use various hooks like:
  - useState
  - useRef
  - useContext
  - useEffect\
 and created my own:
 - useFetching 
 - usePosts
 - useObserver\
 Also for getting API I use **axios** and for\
 dynamic page navigation react-router-dom.
